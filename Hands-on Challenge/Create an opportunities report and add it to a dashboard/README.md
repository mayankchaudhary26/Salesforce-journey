# Problem - Create an opportunities report and add it to a dashboard
Lincoln Ulrich, the top salesperson at Ursa Major Solar, wants a dashboard that shows all the companyâ€™s deals. He wants to see quickly how many opportunities his team has at each stage of the pipeline. Create the underlying opportunities report, then create a dashboard. Add a component that displays the report as a donut chart on the dashboard.
